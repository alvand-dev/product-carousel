# Responsive Product Carousel (Slider)

This is a responsive product carousel (slider) built from scratch without any framework or library (just vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). It has few lines of code so is lightweight and fast. I used a class that you can create as many sliders as you want on a single webpage from it. All used images are free to use and from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).
